subtitle: Where are we now, and where are we going?
intro: I personally have only been involved in the travel industry since 2013, working for one of the world's biggest [meta-search players](http://www.skyscanner.net) in the market before moving on to the business-side of travel, leading the design team at [TravelPerk](http://travelperk.com). Travel has changed a lot in that short space of time and even moreso since my first experience of travel.

### Traveling without care

As a child, when you travel with your family at a young age, you do not consider the broad spectrum of travel, you care only for the destination and activities on hand when you arrive. I recall the many trips we would take to Switzerland to meet with my great granmother who lived over there. The arrival was often the result of a 2 day drive from Scotland, with an overnight ferry crossing.
